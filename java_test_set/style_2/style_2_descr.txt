Style 2 is based off of the Google java style, but with one change:

1. Brackets go on the next line, and are lined up:
public void foo()
{

}
instead of 
public void foo(){

}
Parentheses over multiple lines act the same as in Google java style:
System.out.println(
    "hello"
);
Brackets on a single line remain unchanged
if (true){foo();}
